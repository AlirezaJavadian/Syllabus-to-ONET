Dillard College of Business General Learning Goals Students will demonstrate ethical reasoning skills within a business environment Students will have an understanding of the influence of global and multicultural issues on business activities A. Course Specific Learning Goals Many firms consider their people to be their most important asset. This course is about the management of that asset and it is designed to provide students with an overview of the basic functions of Human Resource Management. Successful students will learn the theories and practices involved in strategic human resource planning, recruiting, selection, performance appraisal, training and development, career development, compensation and benefits, labor relations, safety and health, and equal employment opportunity. The course will also examine the role of the human resources department, the unit charged with managing human resources in all but the smallest organizations. While it is understood that many students in the class will not be going into human resource management (HRM), an exposure to basic concepts and issues involved in HRM is extremely useful to anyone working in a company that employs more than one person. The primary objectives of this course are to provide students with an understanding and appreciation of the basic functions of HRM and current HRM practices and issues. The theories and techniques taught in this course are applicable for all types of positions in all types of organizations in which students may eventually find themselves. Course Policies My Expectations I prefer to treat my students as responsible adults who have made an active choice to be where they are. Since the choice is yours, I expect that you will not only be n top of the course material and tests but also use the available resources including video clips and reaching out to me to ask questions to get the most out of this class. I expect that you will check the D2L for this class regularly (everyday of the semester), read the assigned textbook chapter(s) and any other small readings I give to you in advance of watching the posted lecture. An environment of respect is very important to me and I expect that you will respect me and the other students in this online classroom– no comments will be tolerated which are rude, demeaning, slanderous, prejudicial, or offensive. If there is a university approved absence due to which you are not able to complete an assignment or attend class, I expect that you will discuss the same with me in advance and not after the due date/missed class. Email is the best way to reach me. I check email regularly on my phone as well as on the computer.

Schneider and Barsoux, Managing Across Cultures, 2 nd Edition. ISBN-10: 027364663X • ISBN-13: [PHONE]631 2. Desire2Learn (D2L) website Course Description: International business has become a reality of today’s business world. The world is becoming flat(ter)! Companies across the world are becoming more interconnected. Crumbling of trade barriers, proliferation of technology, and opening up of emerging economies have facilitated doing business across national borders. This course serves as an introduction to the basics of international management. Through a combination of lectures and class participation, we will explore the domain of International Management through three main sections: (1) The meaning of culture, (2) Culture and Management Practice, and (3) Managing Cultural Differences. We will seek to learn the tools and vocabulary necessary for a critical and effective management analysis, thinking, and communication across national borders. Course Prerequisite: Enrolled in the undergraduate business management program. Learning Goals Students will have an understanding of the influence of global and multicultural issues on business activities This is the main goal of this class. I nstruction will occur through discussion of each chapter which have to do with international aspects of management. There will be some application of this skill area in exercises and cases. Each of these items will be assessed as part of the total class point schedule. Competency in Speaking Within Common Business Scenarios Students will practice their oral presentation skills in individual presentations that they will present to the class. Assessment: the student’s ability to present their perspective will be evaluated and included in the point profile for the course. Students will be expected to actively participate in discussions and answer questions, as well as ask their own during these presentations. Competency in writing about common business scenarios Students will answer questions comprised of analyses about each chapter. Hence, practice of written skills occurs through these assignments. Problem [PERSON] and Decision Making Abilities Through Critical Analysis, Evaluation, and Interpretation of Business Information These critical skill areas are practiced through case applications in diagnostic and analytical skills and in cases given to students. They are assessed through the point values given oral discussion/class participation. Students will be able to utilize available technology for common business applications Students will practice this skill area by using word processing, data collection, and the internet. Assessment is reflected in the evaluation of the report. Course Policies Attendance Policy: Students are expected to attend all class meetings for this course, following the university attendance policy. (See Midwestern State University Undergraduate Catalog , Vol. LXXVIII, No. 1, p. 78) . Attendance will be recorded. Unjustified absences will be noted. So as not to disturb the class, one should not walk in and out of the classroom during the class session except for an emergency. Cell phone activity—talking, texting-- is prohibited. Distracting conversation between students sitting in proximity with each other is prohibited. Missed classes can be made up through e mail contact with the professor or with other students. See attendance and class participation section below. My Expectations I prefer to treat my students as responsible adults who have made an active choice to be where they are. Since the choice is yours, I expect that you will not only be attentive to the course material posted but also use the available resources including group discussion, individual project, experiential learning activities, video clips and lecture-discussions to your advantage to get the most out of this class. I expect that you will watch the videos after having read the assigned textbook chapter. An environment of respect is very important to me and I expect that you will respect me and the other students in the class– no comments will be tolerated which are rude, demeaning, slanderous, prejudicial, or offensive. I reserve the right to significantly lower the grade (down to zero on hundred for the participation grade) of a person who takes away from a positive and constructive classroom environment. In some cases I might even remove this person from the online class completely. If there are university excused reasons because of which you will not be able to watch the videos in time for the tests/exams or complete assignments on time, I expect that you will discuss the same with me in advance and not after the due date/missed class. Email is the best way to reach me. I check email on phone and so am very accessible through email. My personal philosophy revolves around fairness so please know that I will put only as much effort into the development of a student and a class as I get from them. Course Format International Management, as other management courses, is best learned through active (not passive) experience and informed debate. My goal is to create an environment that stimulates your thinking and prepare you to use the principles of international management in the business. I have designed this course to promote the objectives described above. The structure of this course will challenge you to think beyond the obvious and constantly apply the concepts, frameworks and tool kits we learn in class to real-life situations. Grading and Evaluation Many different tools are used to test your degree of success at achieving the different learning goals. Here is the breakdown of points in this class: Activity/Assignment Points Distribution Discussion board participation 100 Individual 10 Individual Online Quizzes (10 points each) 100 Individual Exams (3 online exams @ 33 points each, one bonus point added) 100 Individual International Management Country Presentation 100 Individual Total 400 Grades will be determined on the basis of the total points earned. Letter grades will be given according to the following scale: A = 360-400 points B = 320-359 points C = 280-319 points D = 240-279 points F = less than 239 points Late Assignments: Consulting project related assignments are due on the due date mentioned in the syllabus. During each day the assignment is late, its value drops by 25 percent. Should you have any pressing reason for not completing these on time, you should inform me early on. Informing me the day before the due date is not acceptable. GRADING DETAILS Discussion board participation: You are expected to watch all sessions. In addition I expect that you will actively participate in class discussions online. Class participation is graded in the following 2 components: 1) Class discussion per chapter (total 70 points) and 2) Oral presentation questions (total 30 points) 1) Class discussion per chapter (total 70 points): There are 10 Chapters that you can participate in. I will grade participation for a maximum of 7 points per chapter. Contributions that can earn you points consist of meaningful additions to the discussion. We will use a discussion forum on D2L to ask and answer questions. Each chapter will have its own discussion forum that will begin the day we start the chapter and end the day the Exam is due for that chapter. You are expected to use the discussion forum to answer a question that I will post about that chapter on the discussion forum. You are required to give only one contribution per discussion forum. When typing up your answer, use the KISS principle: Keep it short and sweet. I expect no more than one paragraph (4-5 lines, [PERSON]. 200 words). You can earn the full 7 points depending on the quality and thoughtfulness of your answer to the question posted. You will earn at least 4 points for posting ANY answer (minimum 50 characters), as long as it somewhat relates to the topic at hand. This grade increases to 6 or 7 depending on: [PERSON] [PERSON]/quality of your answer . This is the #1 criteria to earn a good participation grade. b. When you answered (i.e. the later you answer/participate in that discussion forum, the higher the bar I will use to grade your answer. Hence there is an incentive to be the first 3-4 people posting on each forum.) c. To the degree you can build off of other’s answers when posting your own answers. Thus if you watch the chapter’s videos later than others and post a question later, please know that one of the ways to earn a full 7 for your answer is if you can intelligently build off another classmates’ answer when posting your contribution. 2) Oral Presentation questions (total 30 points): Upon watching each of the other student’s presentation. You are required to ask at least one question of each team (i.e. one question per country presented). Depending on the quality of your question, you can earn 3 points per presentation or a total of 27 points since we will have 10 presentations (one will your own). I will add 3 bonus points to this score to make it worth a total of 30. These two components combined will give you a final participation grade out of 100. Individual online quizzes : A multiple choice question format quiz will be given for each chapter covered. [PERSON] will be available to take online from the time they are 1 st posted (usually the day we finish the chapter) till the date of the next exam. Quiz format: 15 minutes, 10 questions @ 1 point per question. Exams: There will be 3 online exams that will be based on 33 multiple choice questions (1 point each). One or more of these questions may be on article/cases/video clips that were discussed in class. You have 75 minutes for each exam, starting from when you first start the exam on D2L. International Business Consulting Presentation: Working in teams of 3 this project is an opportunity to demonstrate your knowledge of concepts taught in class by applying them to research the challenges of management and doing business in a specific country that you will pick early during the semester. Acting like a management culture training consultant you will present to the rest of the class on the country you were assigned. You are expected to a cultural expert on that country so make sure you start reading up and researching the country earlier rather than later. You will give the rest of the class a total of a 21 minute oral presentation accompanied with slides (3 seven minute [PERSON] videos of each individual team member with non overlapping content on your assigned country). You will essentially be training the class on the dos and don’ts when working with people from that country. (Example: that country’s attitude towards punctuality, dress codes etc.). You are expected to apply concepts learnt from Chapter1-6 to the country you will be individually assigned in Week 1. At the very minimum the following should be included and discussed: 1) MAIN FOCUS: [PERSON]’s dimensions for that country (i.e. cover low/high context language; uncertainty avoidance; individualism/collectivism; time orientation; power distance; long term/short term orientation). Also other dimensions like proxemics for that country (include for example how to greet someone in this culture), [PERSON] possible provide examples of how each affects a management/busin ess practice in that country. 2) That country’s major industries 3) The political and infrastructural issues that might affect doing business with that country. 4) Where that country falls on the corruption index and thus related business practices that are or are not acceptable there. 5) Worst times to travel to that country for business (major holidays) 6) Superstitions and customs to watch out for when undertaking gift giving or socialization for business in that country. (e.g.: In India you would never gift knives, like a Swiss army knife, to a business contact because it would be considered bad luck and that it would “cut” the relationship) (for this ask interviewee plus do internet research) You final presentation grade will depend on how well you present, how professional you appear, the content of your presentation and its applicability to the course, how deep vs. superficial your analysis of the [PERSON]’s dimensions were, and how well you answered questions posted by me and your classmates in your individual discussion forum for your country.
